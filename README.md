# MemcapacitorSpikingNeuron
Materials for "Fractional order memcapacitive neuromorphic elements reproduce and predict neuronal function" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55784-1


 CarverMead_SpikeAnalysis.m will analyze all the recorded data from the classical and fractional memcapacitor circuits. Start there. 

 RunSimulinkIF.m has the 'spice' model of the Carver Mead circuit with a super-capacitor model.
